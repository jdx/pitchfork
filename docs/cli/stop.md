# `pitchfork stop`

- **Usage**: `pitchfork stop [-a --all] [ID]…`
- **Aliases**: `kill`

Sends a stop signal to a daemon

Uses a graceful shutdown strategy:
1. Send SIGTERM and wait up to ~3 seconds for the process to exit (fast 10ms checks initially, then 50ms)
2. If still running, send SIGKILL to force termination

Most processes will exit immediately after the first SIGTERM. The escalation
ensures stubborn processes are eventually terminated while giving well-behaved
processes time to clean up resources.

When using --all, daemons are stopped in reverse dependency order:
dependents are stopped before the daemons they depend on.

Examples:
  pitchfork stop api           Stop a single daemon
  pitchfork stop api worker    Stop multiple daemons
  pitchfork stop --all         Stop all running daemons in dependency order
  pitchfork kill api           Same as 'stop' (alias)

## Arguments

### `[ID]…`

The name of the daemon(s) to stop

## Flags

### `-a --all`

Stop all running daemons (in reverse dependency order)
