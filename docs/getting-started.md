# Pitchfork

Pitchfork is a CLI for launching daemons with a focus on developer experience.

:::warning
This project is experimental. It works in basic situations but you'll undoubtedly encounter bugs.
:::

## Use-cases

- launching development services like web APIs and databases
- running rsync/unison to synchronize directories with a remote machine

## Features

- Only start daemons if they have not already been started
- Ready check based on delay, output or HTTP response
- Auto start daemons when entering a project directory - then auto stop when leaving
- Restart daemons on failure
- Cron jobs
- ðŸš§ Automatically start daemons on boot

## Workflows

Here's some common ways to use pitchfork.

## Installing pitchfork

[mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev) is the recommended way to install pitchfork.

- mise-en-place â€“ `mise use -g pitchfork`
- cargo â€“ `cargo install pitchfork-cli`
- github - <https://github.com/jdx/pitchfork/releases>

### Launching a one-off daemon

This workflow is an alternative to something like shell jobsâ€”`mytask &`. [`pitchfork run`](/cli/run) just runs a process in
the background:

```bash
pitchfork run docs -- npm start docs-dev-server
```

You need to label the daemon with a name, in this case "docs". Once it's started, "docs" will be how
we reference it. If you run `pitchfork run docs "..."` again, it will not do anything if the daemon
is still runningâ€”this way you can start one-off daemons without thinking if you've already done so.

On [`pitchfork run`](/cli/run), pitchfork will check the running status for a few seconds.
If it fails during that time, it will exit non-zero to help you see if the daemon was configured/setup correctly. See more in [Ready Checks](/ready-checks).

### Adding a daemon to a project

A project may have several daemons defined, this is configured in `pitchfork.toml` in the root of the project:

```toml
[daemons.redis]
run = "redis-server"
[daemons.api]
run = "npm run server:api"
[daemons.docs]
run = "npm run server:docs"
```

You can start all the daemons with [`pitchfork start --all`](/cli/start) or individual ones with their name, e.g.: `pitchfork start redis`.
If it's already started, nothing happens.
You can also have pitchfork automatically start the daemons when entering the project in your terminal with the [shell hook](#shell_hook).

### Adding a global daemon that runs on boot

TODO - implement this

## Shell hook

Pitchfork has an optional shell hook for bash, zsh, and fish that will autostart and autostop daemons when entering/leaving projects.

To install it, run the [`pitchfork activate`](/cli/activate) command below for your shell:

```bash
echo '$(pitchfork activate bash)' >> ~/.bashrc
echo '$(pitchfork activate zsh)' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'pitchfork activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Then when you restart your shell pitchfork will automatically start "autostart" daemons when entering the directory. daemons with
"autostop" will stop daemons when leaving the directory after a bit of a delay if no terminal sessions are still inside the directory.

:::tip
You can also have daemons only autostop. You can manually start them with [`pitchfork start`](/cli/start) then they
will be stopped when you leave the directory.
:::

Here's a `pitchfork.toml` with this configured:

```toml
[daemons.api]
run = "npm run server:api"
auto = ["start", "stop"]
```

## Automatic Retry on Failure

Pitchfork can automatically retry daemons when they exit with an error code. Configure the number of retry attempts using the `retry` field in `pitchfork.toml`:

```toml
[daemons.api]
run = "npm run server:api"
retry = 5  # Retry up to 5 times on error exit
```

When a daemon exits with a non-zero exit code, pitchfork will automatically restart it until the retry count is exhausted. Each retry attempt is tracked, and when all retries are used, the daemon remains in an errored state.

You can also specify retry behavior for one-off daemons using the `--retry` flag:

```bash
pitchfork run my-task --retry 3 -- ./my-flaky-script.sh
```

## Logs

Logs for daemons started with pitchfork can be viewed with [`pitchfork logs`](/cli/logs) or by viewing
the files directly in `~/.local/state/pitchfork/logs`.

```bash
$ pitchfork logs api
[2021-08-01T12:00:00Z] api: starting
[2021-08-01T12:00:01Z] api: listening on
```

You can also view the supervisor logs with `pitchfork logs pitchfork`.

## Supervisor

pitchfork has a supervisor daemon that automatically starts when you run commands like `pitchfork start|run`.
You can manually start/stop it with [`pitchfork supervisor start|stop`](/cli/supervisor/start) or
run a blocking supervisor with [`pitchfork supervisor run`](/cli/supervisor/run).

This watches the daemons status, restarts them if the fail, and a bunch of other things. Ideally
you shouldn't need to really be aware of it. It should just run in the background quietly.

## Configuration

TODO: For now, you'll need to reference [the code](https://github.com/jdx/pitchfork/blob/main/src/env.rs).

## Troubleshooting

You can get extra logs by setting `PITCHFORK_LOG=debug` or `PITCHFORK_LOG=trace` in your environment.
The supervisor will output extra logs but _only_ if this was set when it was started. To ensure the
supervisor is printing debug logs, restart it with this set:

```bash
PITCHFORK_LOG=debug pitchfork supervisor start --force
pitchfork logs pitchfork
```

:::tip
The `--force` is likely needed to kill an existing supervisor process.
